# RageAgainstTheML - Moises ai Challenge

We made some improvements in Daphne Odekerken ACE work (https://daphneo.github.io/DECIBEL/html/index.html). We add more chords and a scraper file that got tabs automatically from audio file in mp3 format. We also made an output .json file with the found chords and their respective times.
